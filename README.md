# Riepete - Riemann Repeater

Receives [statsd](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/) packets and repeats
them to [riemann](http://riemann.io/).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/simao/riepete.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/simao/riepete)
 
## Supported metrics

Currently riepete supports as subset of statsd metrics as defined in
https://github.com/etsy/statsd/blob/master/docs/metric_types.md.

In particular, riepete does not support:

- [sets](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/blob/master/docs/metric_types.md#sets)

- gauges with `-`/`+` modifiers.

The gauges values will still be parsed and accepted by riepete, but
they will be mapped into metrics with the received positive/negative
value and sent to riemann.

## Metrics send to riemann

For each metric received by riepete a new event is sent to riemann.

The event sent to riemann has:

- Its `status` set to `ok`
- Its `hostname` set to the hostname where riepete is running
- Its `description` and `service` set to the key name used in the statsd metric
- Its `tags` set to `statsd, riepete, <metric_type>` where
  `<metric_type>` is one of `Counter`, `Gauge` or `Timer`.

## Caveats

Metrics are repeated to riemann without any type of aggregation. Each
statsd UDP packet will result in a metric being sent to riemann. If
you need some kind of aggregation you will need to do it in
riemann. See the next section for an example on how to do this.

## Example riemann.config file

Since riepete does not aggregate any metrics, you will need to do this
yourself if you need to show aggregated results.

This section shows some examples you can you in your `riemann.config`.

### Rate of events received from riepete

This creates an event every five seconds with with `:metric` set to
the number of events received per second in that interval.

```clojure
(tagged "riepete"
  (with {:metric 1 :state "ok" :service "riepete-events/sec"}
        (rate 5 index)))
```
   
### Calculate rate of events for each statsd metric type

This generates a new event every 5 seconds with `:metric` set to the
rate per second of the last 5 seconds. For example,
`riepete-timers/sec` will show you how many timers per second riemann
received from riepete in the last 5 seconds.

```clojure
(defn as-rate-if-tagged [tags new-name & children]
    (tagged tags
            (with {:metric 1 :state "ok" :service new-name}
                  (rate 5
                        (fn stream [event]
                          (call-rescue event children))))))

(as-rate-if-tagged ["riepete" "timer"] "riepete-timers/sec" index)

(as-rate-if-tagged ["riepete" "counter"] "riepete-counters/sec" index)

(as-rate-if-tagged ["riepete" "gauge"] "riepete-gauges/sec" index)
```


### Calculate rate of events for all counters

This generates a new event for each counter received from
riemann. Each generated event will have the rate of the corresponding
event in the last 5 seconds. Since riepete does not use any
aggregation, this must be done by riepete, but it's as easy as using
this simple code:

```clojure
(tagged-all ["riepete" "statsd" "counter"]
            (by :service
                (adjust [:service #(str "stats.counts." % ".rate")]
                        (rate 5 index))))
```

## Installing

Currently, the easiest way to deploy `riepete` is to build it with
`sbt` and deploy it using `scp`, `fab`, or something
equivalent. [This post](https://simao.io/blog/2014/10/10/deploying-an-akka-app)
might help you deploy it to production.

To create a directory with a compiled version of `riepete`, follow the
following steps:

    git clone <repo>
    cd riepete
    sbt dist
    cd target/riepete-dist

Then to run `riepete`, just run `bin/start`. This should start
`riepete` in the foreground.

## Contributing

Riepete is written in Scala and uses Akka.

No pull request is too small, documentation improvements also very
welcome!
